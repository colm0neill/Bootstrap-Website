# Bootstrap-Website
It is my mission to create a bootstrap website that is both responsive in its layout and responsive in its design. 


Update v1.1
  It is seemingly quite difficult to implement librarys and have them run efficiently.
  The navbar is now working as it should reacting accordling with any adjustments to the screen size
  in both a desktop view and a mobile view.
